									<h1>What is<br />
									My Ideal Job?</h1>
									<p>A link to the job role I am about to explain can be found <a href="seek.com.au/job/51729704?type=standard#searchRequestToken=2a4dc195-7d37-49b1-8cde-c35ba80c7c46"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
									<p>A Cisco Network Engineer has the job of developing and maintaining networks which run on Cisco hardware products. They cover a variety of aspects in relation to the network, such as creating and configuring networks, have the ability to troubleshoot any issues with it, and also ensure maximum security of the network. The position shown above specifically focuses on the infrastructure of the network in terms of day-to-day use, whilst also ensuring that the network and security operations are running as efficiently and effectively as possible. The focus on the infrastructure side of network engineering is what appeals to me especially, as I am curious of the latest technology that is being developed to allow for businesses of any size to run the best they can. The onsite gym, free coffee and food and casual dress code is also attractive to the role.</p>
									<p>In terms of skills for the job, having the ability to manage LAN/WAN networks across several different sites and ensuring they are correctly configured and administered. Also being able to manage voice gateways, fibre channel switches and network security is a must for this role. It is advised to have at least 3 years of recent experience as a network engineer, with solid communication, analytical and problem-solving skills for engaging with business users and project stakeholders. Regarding qualifications, all that is listed is having current Cisco Certifications in Routing and Switching and/or Data Centre.</p>

								<p>Currently, I believe that I excel in having clear and efficient communication skills, so this is an area I think I will naturally fit in to. I also have a very basic knowledge of how LAN/WAN networks work, however of course further knowledge would need to be built.
										I do not possess 3 years of network engineering experience nor the certifications in Cisco networking. A plan to achieve the prerequisites for a role like this would be to complete my bachelor’s degree, choosing Cisco electives in the later years of the degree, to get the Cisco Systems minor. From here, a job role of lesser responsibility should be found to gain experience of how networks are running in businesses. This would also give me experience under my belt to fulfill the 3 years’ experience in network engineering.</p>
