						<p> I am from Melbourne, Australia. My backgrounds include English, Dutch and Italian. I am studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT as a first-year student. Something you may not know about me is that this is not my first course. I actually transferred from Criminology and Psychology (also at RMIT), but after one year I decided that I needed a change. My hobbies include watching and following soccer, running and going to gym, walking my dog and working on my car.</p>

									<h1>My Interests<br />
									in the I.T Industry</a></h1>

									<p> From this point onwards, I had a growing interest in the I.T industry. Originally, I was very curious in graphic design, such as working with Photoshop. This then transcended to learning video editing by using Adobe After Effects and Premiere. Playing around with these powerful tools was an ongoing hobby of mine for years. Creating gunshot lighting effects and other forms of visual effects became a usual event on weekends for me. </p>
									<p> When I got to VCE, I decided to take up Computing as a subject. I remember my high school actually had an excursion day at RMIT, where we attended an I.T open day and learnt about how I.T is taught at a tertiary level. This was the shifting point for me that directed me towards actually working within the I.T field as my career. Learning about how much the I.T Industry is growing with so many job opportunities, it made sense in my mind that I should take this seriously. What also appealed to me was how versatile the industry is. Itâ€™s not as if having a degree in Information Technology limits you to one specific job, but instead branches into a variety of fields such as creating networks, working in UX/UI design or working in cyber security. At this point of my life, I have realised that my brain is not wired to have a specific job that I want to land as a result of my degree. So, the fact that studying I.T opens so many doors is a really comforting thing for me. </p>
									<p>From my studies, I expect to be confident in understanding how and why I.T networks work the way they do. Having thorough knowledge in networking would both be useful for businesses to create or improve their networks, but also makes me appear an expert in my field, which forms trust between the employer and myself. I would also love to have a decent understanding of how to code in HTML, CSS and Java script.  This would be beneficial for creating websites and not having boundaries of what my imagination wants me to create versus what my realistic abilities are. As I alluded to earlier, I love design and using my creative side, so I think being able to make websites would be stimulating for me.</p>
